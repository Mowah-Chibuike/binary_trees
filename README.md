# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Learning Objectives

### General
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree 


## Requirements

### General

- All your header files should be include guarded


## Tasks

### Mandatory
- 0-binary_tree_node.c: a function that creates a binary tree node
- 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c: a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
- 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c: a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
- 3-binary_tree_delete.c: a function that deletes an entire binary tree
- 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c: a function that checks if a node is a leaf
- 5-binary_tree_is_root.c: a function that checks if a given node is a root
- 6-binary_tree_preorder.c: a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
